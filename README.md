Hi :-) Let me introduce myself first. I am a simple and normal human like you, and who belive in the quotation "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now". And, this single line I think speaks volumes regarding me.

Like many others, I come from very humble background and I had and I will have my share of struggle in life. After all that is what is, life is all about and remember our time on this planet is limited so be yourself, contribute to nature make this planet more greener, help society, support your family. All this will not be easy wihout going through mental and physical pain and of course insecurities and uncertainity but there is no chice left, ultimately you have a promise, a commitment and many wishes to fullfill. Belive me at the end you will have a laugh and staisfied smile on you face and in your heart. 

I, assume that I made you a bit emotional that's fine grap a coffee or tea, let emotion pass thorugh. And I forgot to say that I am a father of two beautiful daughters and son of very caring mother, a engineer by choice and I think I have just started my journey.

I am creating this course based on the my personal experience and gathering insights from many books which I do referes will about those during the course.
This course will help someone with 3 to 10 years of experince in the field of IT and mostly are into the web development. Well, it is extremely difficult to create courses
by considering many programming languages and technologies because there are to many options available in the market for example for backend devlelopment one shall consider c# based ASP.NET, JAVA, Python or Node.js. Whatever languages and technology you choose the funtional requirements, non-funtional requirements, design priciples-patterns, overall challenges and limitations remains the same. So choose what ever language and technology you think is right for you and align with your long term goals.

In this course I will be selecting programming lanaguages as C# for ASP.NET, TypeScript for React JS. Distributed architecture based on Microservice pattern.
We will use Docker, Microsoft Azure of deployment and securing our application. Below is the list of complete technologies that we will use.
